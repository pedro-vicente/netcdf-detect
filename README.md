# netcdf-detect
Utility function that detects if an HDF5 file was saved by the netCDF API

Rationale
------------
The netCDF API does not distinguish between a HDF5 file saved by the HDF5 API
or by the netCDF API. This tool provides a means to do that, by using
the HDF5 API to traverse a file and look for metadata.

The netCDF API writes, if variables and dimensions are present in the file:
1) an attribute named "_Netcdf4Dimid" (in some cases)
2) an attribute named "NAME", (always), saved by the HDF5 Dimension Scales API,
that contains the string "This is a netCDF dimension but not a netCDF variable."

This utility tries to detect both attributes, if either case is found it returns a value of 1.
For clarity, return error values are ignored

Dependencies
